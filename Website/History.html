        <h1>History</h1>
        <h2>A study in Musique Concr&egrave;te (performed at LaTex 2011)</h2>
        <p>My first major composition in college not only challenged me with a new method of composition, but pushed the limits of a medium that I felt familiar with.</p>
        <p>I created this piece in Pro Tools using samples of sounds that related to the timline of human history. I stuck to major events, taking a critical look at our follies (facetiously) and also documenting how our accomplishments shaped the way we live now. I employed methods learned from composers of the late 1940's and beyond including Pierre Schaeffer, James Tenney, and John Cage.</p>
        <p>I put together the majority of the piece in Pro Tools, including most of the sound processing parts minus a few samples that I ran through a Pure Data patch built to playback parts of the sample in rapid succession (sometimes overlapping) and changing a few parameters as well (namely transposition, volume, and read point/length).</p>
