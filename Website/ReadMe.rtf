\f0\fs24 \cf0 My valiant first attempt at a website. Have since added javascript/jQuery skills to my repertoire that I haven't been able to implement yet, but this website can provide a decent look at some of my design abilities along with a bit of (albeit unorganized) code.\

Quick note: the structure of the css/html is a bit off, as I made several mistakes early on and didn't catch until much later in the project, but I have done professional web design for the company I last worked for, including HTML5 web apps which display a much more efficient use of my code. Sadly, the confidentiality agreement I signed prohibits me from showing these web apps/web designs.}
