        <h1>Weather Inc v. Humanity</h1>
        <h2>The court case of the century (performed and composed with Ashley Daniels)</h2>
        <p>A duet that utilized arduino boards to provide our sound patches with a variety of inputs. 
        The methods of input involved included weather measurement (i.e. wind speed, wind angle, and rainfall), 
        photoresistors, and photovoltaic sensors used as trigger pads (pictured at the top). The trigger pads 
        control a sampler patch that holds different samples of weather sounds that run through sound processing 
        chains which do a variety of things including transposition, distortion, and a delay effect.</p>
        <p>The weather measurements control an ambient pad that reflects the actions of the performer 
        in regards to the manipulation of the instruments. A fan blows on the wind instruments, and 
        the performer places their hands over the photoresistors to influence certain filter sweeps. 
        At a specific point, the performer also pours a pitcher of water into the rainfall instrument, 
        influencing not only their instrument, but the other instrument as well (i.e. the trigger pads).</p>
        <p>The process for the composition itself began with the idea that weather evolves dynamically, 
        and humanity must constantly adapt via technology or other means to defend itself. This piece takes 
        a new spin on that and creates a "courtroom" argument between the two forces (humanity and weather), 
        with the performers (the humans) attempting to control the instruments (weather). The greatness of 
        the struggle is easily imagined as the performers must be very careful with their actions, or unpleasant 
        sounds occur.</p>
        <p>This patch marked an important time in my development as I harnessed an external interface 
        built specifically from electronic elements utilizing my knowledge of circuitry and analog-to-digital 
        conversion of information to control an audio patch. A video is shown below. I apologize for the quality, 
        but we worked with limited equipment at the time for recording, and the camera's sound didn't quite capture 
        the quality of the piece.</p>
