        <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
        <h2>Composition, coding, interaction design, and performance</h2>
        <p>These 4 concentrations make up the complete nature of my portfolio, and comprise the tools that I 
        have learned to utilize through my studies. My ultimate goal is to work in a collaborative environment 
        that fosters creativity combined with the expectation of excellent production. I have gained a variety of 
        techniques of media presentation that include harnessing control signals from external hardware such as Arduino boards and 
        blob tracking, sound art installation techniques, fixed media utilizing several pieces of software to hone the sound 
        and visuals, and the ability to quickly learn new methods of creation.</p>
        <p>In this website you will find all major projects that I have completed over the last 4 years at Tulane 
        University, along with my r&eacute;sum&eacute; and contact information. Feel free to call or email with any 
        questions or thoughts.</p>
