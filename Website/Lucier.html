        <h1>I Am Sitting in a Remix</h1>
        <h2>Destruction of a groundbreaking electroacoustic masterpiece</h2>
        <p>Forming interesting textures from excerpts of a piece with the same goal in mind 40 years ago. In 1969, 
        Alvin Lucier released "I Am Sitting in a Room" to the critical acclaim of the electroacoustic community. 
        He offered listeners a direct example of resonant frequencies by looping his voice in a single room, which quickly
        turned into a beautiful wash of reverberation.</p>
        <p>I chose to take his famous phrase and chop it up into 20 segments. I took 5 excerpts of the repeat of this phrase, and 
        used these as the foundation for my composition. From there, I sent these pieces through effect chains that tore the sounds
        apart, piece by piece. Throughout the piece, I slowly build these parameters, until the very end where I unveil his famous 
        phrase in its original form.</p>
        <p>On the technical side, I blend a patch in Pure Data with control data from TouchOSC on an iPad. I was able to trigger 
        different parts of his phrase quickly, along with the same parts played in reverse. On top of this is a pre-composed 
        change of the parameters and parameter sweeps that I trigger sounds under. I also have the ability (utilizing the iPad's accelerometer) 
        to speed up and slow down a circling pattern in an 8-channel surround sound environment. Unfortunately, the sound clip 
        below only has around 30 seconds of audio and no video. The patch takes up too much CPU for my computer to record much 
        at all, and I have no access to external recording sources at the moment. However, it gives a representation of how the 
        piece begins, and its compositional trajectory.</p>
